## 🎯 **Quick Start Checklist**

### **Before Recording**
- [ ] Install screen recording software (OBS Studio, Camtasia, etc.)
- [ ] Set up VS Code with a professional theme (Dark+ or Light+)
- [ ] Install the Architex extension locally
- [ ] Prepare the demo project (`demo-project/main.py`)
- [ ] Test all extension features
- [ ] Set up good lighting and audio
- [ ] Prepare your narration script

### **Recording Settings**
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (1080p) or higher
- **Frame Rate**: 30 FPS
- **Audio**: Clear voice narration
- **Cursor**: Smooth, deliberate movements
- **Duration**: Keep each demo under 2 minutes

## 📹 **Demo Scenarios**

### **1. Initial Analysis (30-45 seconds)**
**Goal**: Show the extension analyzing a codebase for the first time

**Steps**:
1. Open VS Code with the demo project
2. Show the Architex sidebar (empty state)
3. Run `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Architex: Analyze Current Workspace"
4. Show progress indicators and analysis
5. Display the results in the Architecture view

**Narration**: *"Let me show you how Architex analyzes your codebase. I'll open a Python project and run the analysis. Notice how it scans your code and identifies components, dependencies, and architectural patterns."*

### **2. Architecture Visualization (45-60 seconds)**
**Goal**: Demonstrate the generated architecture diagrams

**Steps**:
1. Show the Architecture view with components
2. Highlight different element types (modules, classes, functions)
3. Show relationship lines and dependencies
4. Demonstrate zoom and pan functionality
5. Show different diagram layouts

**Narration**: *"Here's the generated architecture diagram. You can see modules, classes, and functions clearly organized. The relationships show dependencies and interactions. You can zoom, pan, and explore different views of your system architecture."*

### **3. Metrics Dashboard (30-45 seconds)**
**Goal**: Show code quality metrics and insights

**Steps**:
1. Open the Metrics view
2. Show complexity metrics with color coding
3. Display coupling and cohesion scores
4. Show maintainability indicators
5. Highlight areas needing attention

**Narration**: *"The metrics dashboard provides code quality insights. Complexity scores, coupling metrics, and maintainability indicators help you identify areas for improvement."*

### **4. AI-Powered Recommendations (45-60 seconds)**
**Goal**: Demonstrate AI-generated insights and suggestions

**Steps**:
1. Open the AI Recommendations view
2. Show component labeling and categorization
3. Display code summarization
4. Show architectural recommendations
5. Highlight confidence scores

**Narration**: *"AI-powered recommendations suggest architectural improvements, identify potential issues, and provide actionable insights. Each recommendation comes with confidence scores and explanations."*

### **5. Live Analysis (60-90 seconds)**
**Goal**: Show real-time analysis as you code

**Steps**:
1. Start live analysis mode
2. Make changes to code files
3. Show real-time updates in the sidebar
4. Demonstrate file watching capabilities
5. Show incremental analysis

**Narration**: *"Enable live analysis to get real-time updates as you code. The extension monitors file changes and provides instant feedback on architectural impact and code quality."*

### **6. Export & Share (30-45 seconds)**
**Goal**: Show export capabilities and sharing options

**Steps**:
1. Export diagram as Mermaid/PlantUML
2. Generate analysis summary
3. Show different export formats
4. Demonstrate sharing capabilities
5. Show integration with other tools

**Narration**: *"Export diagrams in multiple formats including Mermaid, PlantUML, and Graphviz. Share insights with your team or integrate with other development tools."*
